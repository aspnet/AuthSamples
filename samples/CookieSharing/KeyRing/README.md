# Data protection key folder

This file is a placeholder to create a shared folder for data protection keys.

In a production deployment, place the keys outside of the development root and never check-in files in this directory into source control. 
Protect data protection keys in the files with DPAPI or an X509Certificate.

See [Data Protection in ASP.NET Core: Consumer APIs, configuration, extensibility APIs and implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/) for more information.
