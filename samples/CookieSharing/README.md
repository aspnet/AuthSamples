# Cookie Sharing Sample App

The sample illustrates cookie sharing across three apps that use cookie authentication:

* ASP.NET Core 2.0 Razor Pages app without using ASP.NET Core Identity
* ASP.NET Core 2.0 MVC app with ASP.NET Core Identity
* ASP.NET Framework 4.6.1 MVC app with ASP.NET Identity

This sample demonstrates the features described in the [Sharing cookies among applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/compatibility/cookie-sharing) topic.
