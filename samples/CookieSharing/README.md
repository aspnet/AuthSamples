# Cookie Sharing Sample App

The sample illustrates cookie sharing across three apps that use cookie authentication:

| Project                                 | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| CookieSharing.Core                      | ASP.NET Core 2.0 Razor Pages app without using ASP.NET Core Identity |
| CookieSharing.WithIdentity.Core         | ASP.NET Core 2.0 MVC app with ASP.NET Core Identity |
| CookieSharing.WithIdentity.NETFramework | ASP.NET Framework 4.6.1 MVC app with ASP.NET Identity |

This sample demonstrates the features described in the [Sharing cookies among applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/compatibility/cookie-sharing) topic.
