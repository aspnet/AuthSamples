AuthSamples.DynamicSchemes
=================

Sample demonstrating dynamic authentication schemes and options:
1. Run the app, the Home page will show all the authentication schemes.
2. You can add new schemes via the form at the bottom, and remove any via the Remove button.

Index.cshtml and Controllers/AuthController.cs are the most interesting classes in the sample,
as they demonstrate how to add/remove schemes and update the corresponding named options dynamically.
